// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings


// ! When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

// ! var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";


// ? Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// ? I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".



var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
