// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop


// ! For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers. We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

// ? Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.


// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line
for(var i = 1; i < 10; i +=2){
    myArray.push(i);
}




// & 86% Complete Hurra! :D
