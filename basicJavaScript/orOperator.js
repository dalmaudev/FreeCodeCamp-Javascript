// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator


// ! The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false. The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.


// ? Combine the two if statements into one statement which returns "Outside" if val is not between 10 and 20, inclusive. Otherwise, return "Inside".


function testLogicalOr(val) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
    if (val < 10 || val > 20) {
      return "Outside";
    }
  
    // Only change code above this line
    return "Inside";
  }
  
  console.log(testLogicalOr(11));



// & 61% Complete Hurra! :D
