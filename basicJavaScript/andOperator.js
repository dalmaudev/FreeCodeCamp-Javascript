// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Comparisons with the Logical And Operator


// ! Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.


// ? Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the && operator, which will return "Yes" if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return "No".


function testLogicalAnd(val) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
    if (val <= 50 && val >= 25) {
        return "Yes";
    }
  
    // Only change code above this line
    return "No";
  }
  
  testLogicalAnd(10);



// & 60% Complete Hurra! :D
