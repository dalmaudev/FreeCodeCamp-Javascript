// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Passing Values to Functions with Arguments


// ! Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.



// ?  1. Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
// ?  2. Call the function with two numbers as arguments.


function functionWithArgs(a,b) {
    console.log(a+b);
    }
    
functionWithArgs(7,9); // 7+9=16
