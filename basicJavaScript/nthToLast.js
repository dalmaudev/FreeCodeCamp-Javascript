// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String



// ! You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

// ! For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]



// ? Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.



var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
