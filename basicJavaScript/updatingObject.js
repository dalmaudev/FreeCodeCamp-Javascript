// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Updating Object Properties

// ! After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.


// ? Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from "Coder" to "Happy Coder". You can use either dot or bracket notation.


// Setup
var myDog = {
    "name": "Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  myDog.name = "Happy Coder";






// & 76% Complete Hurra! :D
