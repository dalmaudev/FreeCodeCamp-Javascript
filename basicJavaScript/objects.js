// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Build JavaScript Objects

// ! Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

// ! Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

// ? Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".

// ? You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.


var myDog = {
    // Only change code below this line
    
    "name": "Jordi",
    "legs": 2,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["Dog1", "Dog2"]

    // Only change code above this line
    };


// & 73% Complete Hurra! :D
