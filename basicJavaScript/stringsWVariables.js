// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Constructing Strings with Variables


// ! By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

// ! var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
// ! var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ! ourStr is now "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?"



// ? Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"



var myName = "Jordi";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + "and I am well!";







// & 25% Complete Hurra! :D
