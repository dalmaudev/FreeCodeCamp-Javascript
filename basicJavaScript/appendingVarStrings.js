// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Appending Variables to Strings


// ! Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

// ! var anAdjective = "awesome!";
// ! var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
// ! ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"




// ? Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.



var someAdjective = "awesome";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;







// & 25% Complete Hurra! :D
