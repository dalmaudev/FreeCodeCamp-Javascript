// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String



// ! You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string. Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

// ! var firstName = "Ada";
// ! var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1]; // secondLetterOfFirstName is "d"



// ? Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.



var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
