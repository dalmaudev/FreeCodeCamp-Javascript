// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops


// ! You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop. The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true. Check FCC example.

// ? Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.


// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line
var i = 5;
while (i > -1) {
    myArray.push(i);
    i--;
}




// & 85% Complete Hurra! :D
