// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator


// ! We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

// ! var ourStr = "I come first. ";
// ! ourStr += "I come second.";


// ? Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: "This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.



var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence."








// & 24% Complete Hurra! :D
