// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Variables

// ! Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.


// ? Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.


// Setup
var testObj = {
    12: "Namath",
    16: "Montana",
    19: "Unitas"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  var playerNumber = 16;       // Change this line
  var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this line






// & 75% Complete Hurra! :D
