// * Solution of Basic JavaScript: Access Array Data with Indexes

// ! We can access the data inside arrays using indexes. Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. 



// ? Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.


var myData = myArray[0];
